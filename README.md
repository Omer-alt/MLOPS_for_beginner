# Introduction ToMachine Learning Operations

This project involves setting up version control and developing a simple ML pipeline. Start by creating a GitHub repository, initializing Git, and setting up a .gitignore file. Set up a Python environment with virtualenv and document dependencies in requirements.txt.

Build a basic ML pipeline by loading the Iris dataset, training a logistic regression model, and evaluating its performance. Write unit tests using pytest and create visualizations for data and model outputs. Collaborate with peers through branches and pull requests on GitHub. As a bonus, learn to handle and remove accidentally committed secret files.
