## Introduction ToMachine Learning Operations

### day 1
This project involves setting up version control and developing a simple ML pipeline. Start by creating a GitHub repository, initializing Git, and setting up a .gitignore file. Set up a Python environment with virtualenv and document dependencies in requirements.txt.

Build a basic ML pipeline by loading the Iris dataset, training a logistic regression model, and evaluating its performance. Write unit tests using pytest and create visualizations for data and model outputs. Collaborate with peers through branches and pull requests on GitHub. As a bonus, learn to handle and remove accidentally committed secret files.

### day 4
In this lab, you explored the following topics:

    - Synchronous vs. Asynchronous programming in Python
    - Building an API with FastAPI
    - Serving machine learning models through an API
    - Validating input data with Pydantic
    - Dockerizing and deploying a FastAPI app to the cloud
This lab prepares you for building scalable machine learning APIs in production environments.
